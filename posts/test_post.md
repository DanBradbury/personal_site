Programming is not for everyone. Most people write off the idea of pursing a career in computing because they couldn't imagine "staring at a computer screen all day". To be fair if you are not font of computer screens then things would be quite problematic but ...

    count = 0
    for(i=0;i<10;i++) {
        for(j=0;j<10;j++) {
            count += 1
        }
    }
    puts count

With a basic understanding of counting anyone should be able to figure out what will be printed out after the code is executed.
